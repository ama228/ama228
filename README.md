### Hey, I'm Amar

Python developer focused on building tools and libraries. I like working on parsers, CLI tooling, caching systems, and contributing to open source.

**What I work on:**
- Backend systems and Python libraries
- Parsing and tokenization (config formats, duration strings, query languages)
- Connection pooling, caching, and performance
- CLI tools and developer tooling
- AI model training and evaluation

**Some things I've built:**

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [smart-config-parser](https://github.com/ama228/smart-config-parser) | Config string parser with quoted values, ranges, validation |
| [pypool](https://github.com/ama228/pypool) | Thread-safe connection pool with overflow and timeouts |
| [timedeltaparser](https://github.com/ama228/timedeltaparser) | Parse "1h 30m" style durations into timedelta objects |
| [pytaskrunner](https://github.com/ama228/pytaskrunner) | Task runner with dependency resolution and cycle detection |
| [cachelimit](https://github.com/ama228/cachelimit) | HTTP response cache with size budgets and TTL |

**Open source contributions:**
- [Textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) - Fixed Column class docstring
- Also exploring httpx, click, arrow, pyparsing, sqlalchemy

**Stack:** Python, pytest, SQLAlchemy, httpx, Click, asyncio, Git
