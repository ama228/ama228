### Hey, I'm Amar

Python developer working on AI/ML tooling and backend systems. I build practical libraries for RAG pipelines, LLM evaluation, prompt engineering, and code analysis.

**What I work on:**
- RAG pipelines, vector search, and hybrid retrieval systems
- LLM evaluation frameworks (ROUGE-L, BLEU, code correctness, RLHF comparison)
- Prompt engineering tooling and automated prompt testing
- Static analysis and AI-assisted code review
- Backend systems, connection pooling, caching, and CLI tools

**AI/ML Projects:**

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [rag-pipeline](https://github.com/ama228/rag-pipeline) | RAG system with chunking, vector store, hybrid search, and retrieval |
| [llm-eval](https://github.com/ama228/llm-eval) | LLM evaluation toolkit - ROUGE-L, BLEU, fuzzy match, code correctness, RLHF pairwise comparison |
| [ai-code-reviewer](https://github.com/ama228/ai-code-reviewer) | AST-based Python code reviewer with complexity analysis and optional LLM integration |
| [promptlab](https://github.com/ama228/promptlab) | Prompt template engine with variables, conditionals, runner with retries, and testing framework |

**Python Libraries:**

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [smart-config-parser](https://github.com/ama228/smart-config-parser) | Config string parser with quoted values, ranges, validation |
| [pypool](https://github.com/ama228/pypool) | Thread-safe connection pool with overflow and timeouts |
| [timedeltaparser](https://github.com/ama228/timedeltaparser) | Parse "1h 30m" style durations into timedelta objects |
| [pytaskrunner](https://github.com/ama228/pytaskrunner) | Task runner with dependency resolution and cycle detection |
| [cachelimit](https://github.com/ama228/cachelimit) | HTTP response cache with size budgets and TTL |

**Open source contributions:**
- [Textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) - Fixed Column class docstring
- Also exploring httpx, click, arrow, pyparsing, sqlalchemy

**Stack:** Python, pytest, RAG, LLM eval, vector search, AST analysis, SQLAlchemy, httpx, asyncio, Git
